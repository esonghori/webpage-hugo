My name is Ebrahim M. Songhori (in Persian: ابراهیم سنقری). I'm a PhD student in ACES (Adaptive Computing and Embedded Systems) lab at Rice University. I’m advised by Prof. Farinaz Koushanfar. I'm interested in Computer Architecture, Secure Multi-party Computation, Embedded System Design, FPGA and ASIC design, High Performance Computing and Big Data Analysis. I received M.Sc. from Rice University in 2014 and B.Sc. from the University of Tehran in 2011.
